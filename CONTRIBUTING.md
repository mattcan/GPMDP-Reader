## Submitting changes

[Please send a GitHub Pull Request to GPMDP-Reader][issue-tracker-pr] with a clear list of what you've done. When you send a pull request, please try to include tests. Tests work as examples as well as some proof that a feature or fix works. Please make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

```sh
$ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
> 
> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
```
